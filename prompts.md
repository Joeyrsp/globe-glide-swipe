create a mobile friendly web experience that mimics tinder's swiping interface but themed around flight destinations. each "profile" card should have a mainn feature image and text with the location name, region, distance, and maybe 1 extremely short sentence with trivia. when liking a location it should be added to the wishlist unless it has a deal running for it in which case it "matches" immediately and shows the deal for that location. between location "profiles" sprinkle question cards that would contribute to the users profile (e.g. are you travelling for food/views/escape from children). build a view to see and add to the profile

make the next destination card load underneath the current one so that when the top card is being dragged the bottom one can be seen. also make it so that when you let go of a dragged card, it completes an animation going off screen in that direction, leaving the next card in place underneath instead of replacing the top card's content with the next card's.
split the exclusive deal section out from the "its a match" screen into a second screen and change the "book now" button to "see your deal" which opens the second screen. this second screen should have a heading, image, a book now button, and a save for later button again.
add an intro screen with a start swiping button that leads into the rest of the flow.
make it visually match the attached screenshot better.
